Hi, I am Khrystyna and I am working on deep learning-based biomedical image analysis at the [Computational Pathology Group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/), under the supervision of [Geert Litjens](https://geertlitjens.nl/) and [Jeroen van der Laak](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/jeroen-van-der-laak/). My work focuses on domain shift in histopathology and outcome prediction from histopathology slides. I have a background in physics and biomedical image analysis. 

I am interested in AI for scientific discovery, AI interpretability, and outcome prediction in computational pathology. Besides, I like programming, photography, fitness, and travelling.
