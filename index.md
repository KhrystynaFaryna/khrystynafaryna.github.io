Hi, I am Khrystyna Faryna - a PhD researcher working on deep learning-based medical image analysis with the Computational Pathology Group (CPG), under the supervision of Geert Litjens and Jeroen van der Laak. In 2017, I obtained a BSc in Physics from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine. In 2020, I obtained a Joint MSc in Medical Imaging and Applications (MaIA) from the University of Girona (Spain), UNICAS (Italy) and the University of Bourgogne (France), as a recipient of the European Union: Erasmus+ EMJMD scholarship. My past affiliations also include Middle East Technical University (Turkey) and the Carl E. Ravin Advanced Imaging Laboratories at Duke University Medical Center (USA).

# PROJECTS

 - **Automatic data augmentation for H&E-stained histopathology** - [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482524001021) using AutoML to find optimal data augmentation hyperparameters for H&E-stained histopathology. Pytorch code is available [here](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/pathology-he-autoaugmetation) and TensorFlow one is [here](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/pathology-he-auto-augment).

 - **AI assisted Gleason grading "in the wild"** - co-organizer of an interactive workshop at the Computational Pathology Symposium

 - **LEOPARD challenge** - co-organizer of a deep learning challenge in histopathology [LEOPARD](https://leopard.grand-challenge.org/). The task of this challenge is to predict the time to biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer from histopathology slides.
