Hi, I am Khrystyna - a PhD researcher working on deep learning-based biomedical image analysis with the [Computational Pathology Group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/), under the supervision of [Geert Litjens](https://geertlitjens.nl/) and [Jeroen van der Laak](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/jeroen-van-der-laak/). My work focuses on domain shift in histopathology and outcome prediction from histopathology slides. I studied Physics for my BSc at [TSNUK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko_National_University_of_Kyiv), Ukraine. In 2020, I obtained an [Erasmus+ Joint MSc in Medical Imaging and Applications (MaIA)](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/) grant. I have worked with the classification and label extraction from radiology reports at [RAI Labs](https://sites.duke.edu/railabs/) Duke University Medical Center, USA.

Currently, I am interested in domain shift, foundational models, drug discovery, and outcome prediction in computational pathology. Besides, I like programmimg, photography, working out, good clothes and travelling.
